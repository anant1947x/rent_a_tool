🧠 Problem Statement
"In our college, students often need to borrow tools for workshops, labs, or personal projects. Currently, this process is handled manually — usually by writing names in a notebook or using informal methods. This leads to several issues: tools get lost, there's no clear record of who borrowed what, and delays happen when students can't find the tools they need. It also becomes difficult for staff to manage everything efficiently.

My project solves this by creating a website where students can easily rent tools online, and staff can track and manage tool rentals from a central system."

💡 How Our Website Works – Rent-A-Tool
Login Access:
Only verified college users (students, teachers, or employees) can log in.

Tool Listing by Admin:
The admin adds tools into the system. For example, if there are 4 units of a 3D printer, the system automatically tracks availability based on pre-bookings and the dates selected by users.

Browse Tools:
Users scroll through a list of tools available for rent.

Select and Book:
Choose the tool, select your booking dates, and proceed to book.

Rental Bill:
The total rental amount is shown at the time of booking. You can choose to pay immediately or later.

Tool Pickup:
Collect the tool from the designated spot on campus.

Early Submission:
Returning tools before the rental period ends doesn’t lead to a refund.

Late Return Penalty:
Delayed submission results in a penalty.

Return Approval:
Admin checks the tool's condition and then approves its return on the system.

Damage Penalty:
If the tool is damaged, the admin can charge a fine to the user’s account.




⚙️ Key Features
🔔 Notifications:
Automatic email/SMS reminders for upcoming return dates.

📜 Rental History:
View all your past and current rentals in one place.

💳 Credit System:
If your pre-booked tool isn’t available on time due to another user’s late return or maintenance, you’ll receive a credit token. This token gives you a discount on your next rental.
The credit comes from a portion of the late fine charged to the previous user, as a way to compensate you for the inconvenience.




Rental Charges
🔹 Normal Tools (e.g., Screwdrivers, Multimeters, Soldering Irons, etc.):
	Rental Rate: 0.5% to 1% of the tool’s original price per 3 days.
	Billing Cycle: Rental charges are calculated in blocks of 3 days.
	(Example: 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, and so on.)

🔹 Expensive and Sensitive Tools (e.g., 3D Printers, DSLR Cameras, CNC Machines, etc.):
	Rental Rate: 1% to 2% of the tool’s original price per 3 days.
	Billing Cycle: Same as above — in multiples of 3 days.

✅ Important: Students can only book tools for periods that are multiples of 3 days (example: 3, 6, 9, 12 days).
 


Late Return Fine
If a user returns a tool late, a fine will be applied.

Fine Amount:
➔ Double the normal 3-day rental charge will be added for each 3-day delay.
(Example: If normal rent for 3 days is ₹30, late fine = ₹60 for each late 3-day block.)



 Credit System (Compensation for Delay)
🔸 If a student’s pre-booked tool is not available on time (because the previous user returned it late or it was under maintenance), the system will compensate them.

🔹 How it works:

The affected user receives a Credit Token.

The credit provides a free rental worth 3 days for their next booking.

This credit is funded from a part of the late fine collected from the user who caused the delay.



✅ Conclusion
The Rent-A-Tool website helps students and teachers in college borrow tools in an easy and smart way.

Right now, the tool booking system is done on paper, which causes confusion, delays, and missing tools. My website makes this process faster and better by using a simple online system.

Students can see which tools are available, book them, and get reminders. Admins can manage all the tools easily and check who has what.

The system also gives credit if a student faces problems because of a late return by someone else.

Overall, this project saves time, reduces tool loss, and makes tool-sharing more organized and fair for everyone.
